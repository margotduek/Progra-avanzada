    Program to test concentration counting exercise

    The problem:
    There is an exercise to develop concentration, where two numbers are chosen,
    the first will count up from 0, and the second counts down from 100.
    The player must keep counting in his head, adding and substracting each time
    from both sides. Example, in the range 0-100, adding 3 and substracting 4:
     3 - 96
     6 - 92
     9 - 88
    12 - 84
    15 - 80
    etc.

    You must write a program that can do this calculations, but the increment
    must be done in one process and the decrement in a different process.
    The parent will be the one who decides when to stop, so the two processes
    must keep constant communication. The child will send the updated value
    to the parent, and the parent will reply with a boolean value indicating
    whether the child should continue or it has finished already.
    The program will ask the user for the size of the range, and the amounts
    to add and substract

    You must show visually the progress of these counts, by using a dynamically
    sized string, initially filled with spaces. As the counts progress, the
    string will be filled with the '\' character from left to right, and with
    the '/' character from right to left. If the two counts intersect, you
    should write the 'X' character instead.
    Example, in the range 0-20, adding 4 and substracting 2

    4 -   18\\\\              //
    8 -   16\\\\\\\\        ////
    12 -   14\\\\\\\\\\\\  //////
    16 -   12\\\\\\\\\\\\XXXX////
    20 -   10\\\\\\\\\\XXXXXXXXXX
    20 -    8\\\\\\\\XXXXXXXXXXXX
    20 -    6\\\\\\XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    20 -    4\\\\XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    20 -    2\\XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    20 -    0XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

    You must use pointer arithmetic to modify the string. Index notation is not
    allowed for this part of the test.

    QUESTIONS:
    Complete the following three functions to make the program work:
        - countUp
        - countDown
        - drawLine
    The description of what each does is at the end of this file.
    Write your functions there 

    HINTS:
        - Write your name in this comment and in the "main" function
        - Read all of the existing code before answering anything. This will help you
            understand what needs to be done and how to do it
        - Keep calm. Think what you have to do before typing code
        - Write clean code and use correct indentation
        - Add comments to your code
        - You can add any other functions that you need to make your code more organized
